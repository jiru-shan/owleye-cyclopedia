        <header className="articleTitle">An interview with Owl Eyes in regards to Gatsby's death</header>
        <p className="analysis">Interviewer: To begin with, how familiar were you with Gatsby?</p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: Not that familiar. I was invited by someone and so I just came and went.</p>
        <p className="analysis">Interviewer: Then did Gatsby's death sadden you?</p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: .....</p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: To an extent, yes.</p>
        <p className="analysis">Interviewer: May I ask why?</p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: It's a combination of lot's of things. I guess seeing someone who was so successful pass was part of it. </p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: But, more than anything, I guess it was the lack of people at his funeral. There was no one there. For someone so sucessful there was no one. It was like he was wiped off the face of the Earth. It made me kind of lose faith</p>
        <p className="analysis">Interviewer: I see. Then is there anything you would've wanted to tell Gatsby?</p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: Not really, it is what it is. I guess maybe I would've told him to keep his facade up for longer, to keep the hope alive.</p>
        <p className="analysis">Interviewer: What do you mean by that?</p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: Nothing much.</p>
        <p className="analysis">Interviewer: I guess that's that then. Any other comments?</p>
        <p className="analysis">Owl Eyes: I guess....Gatsby, you and your dream will be missed fondly.</p>
